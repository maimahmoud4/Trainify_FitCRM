# Trainify — Simple Client Manager (Frontend Demo)

**Trainify** is a frontend-only POC (proof-of-concept) web app for managing fitness clients.  
This project was built to satisfy the CSCE 4502 assignment requirements: a responsive HTML/CSS frontend with three pages (Home, Add Client, Client List).

├── index.html # Home (Welcome) page

```

## Features
- **Home page** with hero and feature cards.

- **Client List page** with 10 sample clients, search/filter by name, and placeholder Edit/Delete actions.
